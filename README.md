# Frontiers in Cellular Neuroscience - Supplementary Code for Allen Brain Observatory Data Analysis

This repository contains supplementary code for the analysis of data from the Allen Brain Observatory, specifically the 2-photon Visual Coding dataset, and the study by Stringer et al. (2019) titled "High-dimensional geometry of population responses in visual cortex".

## Introduction



## Data Sources

The data used in this analysis is based on the Allen Institute MindScope Program's Allen Brain Observatory - 2-photon Visual Coding dataset. This dataset provides recordings of neuronal responses in the mouse visual cortex to different visual stimuli.

In addition, the analysis also references data from the study by Stringer et al. (2019) titled "High-dimensional geometry of population responses in visual cortex". This study provides valuable insights into the high-dimensional nature of population responses in the visual cortex.

## Usage

To use the code in this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Ensure you have the required dependencies installed, including MATLAB and relevant toolboxes.
3. Download the Allen Brain Observatory - 2-photon Visual Coding dataset and Stringer et al.'s dataset from their respective sources.
4. Modify the code as needed to specify the file paths and data loading procedures.
5. Run the code to perform data analysis.
